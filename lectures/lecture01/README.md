## Lecture 1: Why Structure Matters

This notebook reproduces the live demos from Lecture 1.

You can:
- run it top-to-bottom to reproduce results
- modify hyperparameters
- compare MLP vs CNN (see optional section)

You are *not* expected to understand every line yet.
Focus on:
- what breaks
- what helps
- what doesn’t

### Environment setup (recommended)

We provide a Conda environment for local execution.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gdl
```
If you prefer not to install anything locally, you can run
all lecture notebooks directly in Colab using the badge.

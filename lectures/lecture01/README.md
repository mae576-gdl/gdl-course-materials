## Lecture 1: Why Structure Matters

This notebook reproduces the live demos from Lecture 1.

You can:
- run it top-to-bottom to reproduce results
- modify hyperparameters
- compare MLP vs CNN (see optional section)

You are *not* expected to understand every line yet.
Focus on:
- what breaks
- what helps
- what doesn’t
